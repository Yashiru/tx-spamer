# Transaction spammer

**A Rust-based tool for spamming a transaction.**

## Objective

This tool is designed to facilitate the rapid dispatch of a high volume of identical transactions. While its application may seem unconventional, it proves advantageous under specific use cases.

## Disclaimer

This project primarily serves as an educational platform to experiment with Rust. While its current implementation is functional, it's quite possible that improvements could be made. Suggestions and enhancements are encouraged to help me further develop my expertise in Rust.
